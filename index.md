# Self-Assessment


I began my SNHU computer science program in May of 2017. I did not have any 
prior college or university experience here at SNHU. I graduated high school 
in 1997 and chose a different career path before ending up here at SNHU some
years later. I currently work as a Senior Application Programmer for a 
pharmaceutical company. I have worked in an IT type role since 2009. I began 
my IT career working on a help desk and within a few years transitioned to 
an application and database support person. I currently work as a programmer 
but the roleis more of a business analyst role.
	
My education program here at SNHU has introduced me to many new opportunities
that I can utilize to further my career. I was able to sharpen skills I already
had and learn new ones that will benefit me in the long run. I am detail 
oriented, determined and professional. SNHU helped sharpen these skills while 
adding new ones and expanding my knowledge. Throughout my computer science 
program, I was able to learn and work on different programming languages and 
applications that I can utilize in the future. I was able to become familiar 
with Java, MySQL, C++, Python and SAS. I was also able to become familiar with
the tools I can use in the future to build my own programs and applications 
like NetBeans and Eclipse IDE. This program course had us collaborating in 
groups, showed us how to appropriately communicate with our stakeholders and 
colleagues as well as work with different data structures, algorithms and 
software engineering. Communication was used in different aspects throughout 
our courses. Such as we had to communicate with each other in discussion posts 
as well as we reviewed our classmates work and provided feedback and generated 
professional documents towards stakeholders while working on a project management 
course. 
	
Developing my ePortfolio, I needed to refresh my memory while enhancing prior 
projects. I appreciated this since it allowed me to experience what it would be 
like to potentially work on someone else’s program or go back and update a 
program or application I may have created some time ago. I was able to review 
the code and programs and read through the comments I had added and decide how 
to update them and make them more complex and efficient. My ePortfolio allowed 
me to highlight my prior work and show new skills that I have learned. It allowed 
me to display my programs and how I utilized standards and how I approached 
required projects. Throughout some of these courses, I was required to work in 
different areas I had not worked on in the past. I had to learn and think how 
to approach new projects and problems and find manners of completing the tasks 
assigned. This is something that is helping prepare me as I move forward in my 
career. The overall lessons taught us how to appropriately communicate with 
different audiences, how to work in groups and across potential departments as 
well as how to approach the many different things we will face in our careers. 
My IT-328 course allowed me to learn about the different techniques of project 
management and how to work within a team and how to communicate as a team. 
	
In collaborating in a team environment, we need to ensure we are in harmony with 
the other team members. When you work on a program, code or any other technical 
project, you need to ensure that what your part does not interfere or potentially 
break the work that someone else has done. You may be tasked to integrate some 
code or enhancement into an existing program while someone else works on another 
portion, you need to be able to work together to implement both of the changes 
and keep the integrity of the program. An example of this was for my CS-310 course 
where we created a jukebox using java and each student had to upload and commit 
updates to this jukebox with their own list of artists. Initially, when the first 
few students uploaded and committed their updates, some issues occurred where our 
professor had to reset the initial program. We were taught a valuable lesson here 
on how to commit and work on a single project as a team. 
	
Throughout the courses, I was able to learn new things and develop new skills. I 
was able to work with data structures, algorithms, software engineering and 
databases. An example of software design and engineering was the project I 
completed for my CS-330 course. For this course, we worked in C++ and worked 
creating visualization programs. This was the most difficult course I have 
taken in regard to coding and programming. Many of the languages like Java and 
Python have similar syntax with some subtle differences. C++ took me by surprise 
and gave me some trouble initially on how to complete some tasks. The examples 
and weekly tasks we were provided did help me become more comfortable with it 
and I was able to complete what I consider a very impressive final project. I 
created a cup similar to a yeti tumbler, have the cup spin, and allow for shading, 
texture, lighting and resizing. As for algorithms and data structures, I took a 
few courses that helped me develop my skills in this area. One notable course was 
my CS-340 course where we worked with RESTful API and MongoDB. These were new areas
to learn similar to the C++ course. This course was also a little difficult for me 
to pick up initially. It took me hours of trying to understand it better. My 
determination got me through this course. This course allowed us to understand more 
of how to manage databases. We had to use CRUD, which stands for create, read, 
update and delete. These are the necessary actions to manage any database. For this 
course and project, we created a database and manipulated it using CRUD using
RESTful API commands. 
	
Concerning databases, I had some prior knowledge in prior and current companies. 
I have worked with Oracle applications and databases for some years now. Some 
of the courses I took regarding databases were DAT-220, which centered on data 
mining as well as CS-340, which I mentioned previously. The DAT-220 course 
showed us how to analyze data and build an analysis plan. We used JMP, which 
is an analytical tool similar to SAS. SAS actually owns JMP.  I previously 
analyzed JMP for use at work. It is an impressive and powerful tool. The analysis 
we did for this course required us to generate visual aids in analyzing data. The 
data was for a shrimp sales company that had one restaurant and were looking to 
understand more of where there larger sales were and get a more granular view of 
their sales. I broke down the data analysis into age groups, sales by income of 
the patrons as well as generated different cluster analyses. 

The artifacts I chose for this CS-499 course and as my enhancements were part of 
projects I worked on for my IT-145 course as well as my DAD-220 course. I chose 
two projects to make my three enhancements. The two projects do not particularly 
relate to each other aside from displaying the skills I learned in coding. I used 
the standard practices across both in that I used commenting and proper layout to
apply to my code. For the DAD-220 course, I needed to create different MySQL queries
to accomplish different tasks. This didn’t require commenting in the sense that the
other project did, but I did add notes where needed to display what task it was 
relating too as well as what the execution of it would accomplish. The artifact 
enhancements made me look at previous work and re-familiarize myself with the 
programs and queries where I had to read the code and consider what adjustments and 
enhancements I could make. It took me some time to decide on what enhancements to 
make without compromising the existing programs and code. I was able to display some 
of the learning experiences I had by making the enhancements successfully. I was able
to utilize different skills in making these enhancements and creating my narratives. 

In my current position and future career goals, I plan to use everything I learned
here at SNHU in my computer science program and put my new and sharpened skills to 
good use. I would like to continue to grow and learn new techniques and applications
I can utilize within the computer science field. As my knowledge grows and skill set
grows, I can become more versatile and have more opportunities. I can become 
beneficial to different organizations and groups were my knowledge could be used. 
Being well rounded in the computer science field is important as different aspects
of the work entail you to be. I can assist organizations as a project manager, 
business analyst or programmer as needed. My education has provided me the benefit 
of offering multiple technical and professional needs.
